This is my website using the hosting service Blot (https://blot.im) that allows you to turn folders into a website. 
Inside here are my different Markdown files for various texts on the homepage and posts, and then the templates folder contains all of the stylization.

These are not the files that run my website, but the ones that I use to design my website.
