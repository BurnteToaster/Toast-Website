# I GOT THE JOB

Wow what a wild series of events. I just got hired by Woolpert to be a Junior Software Engineer. The crazy part is that this is my very first job offer.
I didn't even apply to them, they came to me and wanted to hire me, and now I am super super excited to work there. HTML, CSS, and JS? Fully remote? let's goooo!!

The screening questions weren't difficult for me either which is a REALLY good sign that this is an environment that I will thrive in. I answered my heart out of those questions, and I am so so so happy it got me here. I hope my new co-workers are accepting and also just fun people to work with. All of my family is really excited, my friends are congratulating me, and I am realizing that it's all been worth it. Every step.

Thank you Woolpert for the opportunity to start my career! <3
