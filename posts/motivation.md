# motivation

Lately it has been difficult to find motivation to do work. Don't get me wrong, I am very passionate about game programming and music, but I feel like my brain isn't allowing me to do the work. Perhaps today has been a long day, but I do sense a bad pattern that doesn't allow me to be my best while working.

It is like this: I have the capacity to learn and the knowledge of how to learn what I need to learn, but I can only access those things at certain times or under certain conditions. ADHD in a nutshell I suppose. I do tend to blame the current global political climate with the mulitple genocides going on in the world in combination with living in a country that supports those genocides and therefore anything I do will only support our country, which is hard to keep my mind unoccupied of because my neurodivergent brain has justice sensitivity. The more I read on and on about how more people are dead, the U.S. government did or said something terrible, or IDF soldiers mocking Palestinians, the more I feel like I am not meant for this world. It is a strong claim, but it is indeed true as we continue to support injustices systematically.

Anyways, I am still applying for jobs and it continues to be a struggle, but hopefully I will hear back from the State of Maryland or this sketchy DataAnnotation site (which isn't a scam? I am still unsure, but I haven't given them my debit card information yet).

I also plan to get the CompTIA Security+ certification which may or may not help in the job search, especially being a cybersecurity major. I had talked to a cybersecurity professional who works at Navy Federal Credit Union, and I had asked him whether it was worth to get a CISSP certification since I had taken a class using that book. He told me that HE recently got his CISSP, and that it usually requires 5+ years of experience. So one certification at a time.

If you got to the end of this, I appreciate you :3
