# Music Has Been Made

This is just a general update about work I am doing. I have finally finished a 10-min dance piece for my friend at UMBC who is a dance major.
It was a lot of fun creating it, but it proved to be quite the challenge until the very end (yesterday).

I titled this piece *Sweet Promises / Shattered Dreams* because part of the theme I received from my friend was "femininity". It is a very broad and vague idea, but she wanted it in a specific way so that helped not only with starting the piece, but also getting feedback from various sections (after all it is a long piece). I think this piece fits the title musically, and this piece shows "femininity" within its beauty, pride, and resilience that has room for emotion.

All this to say: I am finished! :3
Now I can really focus on working on my games, getting this CompTIA Security+ certification, and of course job applications.
