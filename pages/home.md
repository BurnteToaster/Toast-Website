#### Current Projects
Music Project
- A dance student at University of Maryland, Baltimore County asked me to create music for her choreography. This piece is 10 minutes long. The initial thought process was to create a "heels" song that is in a 6/8 time signature. I took creative liberty to create a triplet groove in that 6/8 to create a "wavey" effect. The piece is officially complete and is called *Sweet Promises/Shattered Dreams*. The performance will be in May.

First Game
- For my first (real) game/first try with a game engine, I wanted to make a combination of hide and seek with hitscan movement shooter mechanics where the player models and the map are geometrically equivalent to allow players to hide. I wanted this to disable the concept of "kill-stealing" where each person has their own individualised set of "health bars" (total time spotted in this case) so that way no one person can just hide forever and spot the last person to win. There's a lot to say as I've thought this out in-depth, but so far I have the basic movement mechanics, the health/total time spotted mechanics, and some prefabs equivalent to the player for maps.

Second Game // [Source](https://github.com/BurnteToaster/unnamed-galaga-roguelike)
- For my second game after the Unity debacle(tm), I decided to give Bevy a try since I had been hearing some good things about it. I did need to teach myself Rust, but Bevy still uses ECS so the knowledge of game engines transferred easily. Originally, I wanted to create a Galaga-like game to just make a simple game, but I decided to take a more rogue-like approach (think Brotato) where you have to survive waves and upgrade between them. The niche trick I wanted to add is that you play this game only with your mouse, but I will not spoil any more of it.

This Website // [Source](https://github.com/BurnteToaster/Toast-Website)
- Obviously working on refining this website to my liking. I want to be able to add links to my projects in GitHub when I do upload them, and maybe be able to share some code I'm using that I thought was neat.
